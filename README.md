# NYC Traffic and Parking Analysis - GA Capstone Project

## Introduction
This repository holds the technical report and supporting analysis for examining parking violations and vehicle crashes in New York City for the fiscal year 2023. The project uses Python and Tableau to conduct a comprehensive analysis, targeting data-driven insights that can help shape urban traffic and parking policies.

## Project Overview
The analysis explores over 13 million parking violation records and associated vehicle crash data, offering insights into:
- Trends and patterns in parking violations
- Peak times and locations for traffic incidents
- Revenue generated from parking fines

## Methods
The dataset was preprocessed to exclude columns with over 50% null values and a subset of 1,000,000 tickets was analyzed to identify key trends using:
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive dashboards to visualize the findings dynamically

## Key Insights
- **High Violation Areas**: Concentrations of parking violations were most notable in Midtown Manhattan, the Lower East Side, and the Upper West Side.
- **Time Analysis**: The frequency of violations peaked during early morning and early evening hours, with August, September, and October being the busiest months.
- **Safety Concerns**: Analysis of crash data revealed high incidents during rush hours, with major contributing factors including distracted driving and failure to yield the right of way.

## Recommendations
Based on the findings, the following recommendations are proposed:
- **Enhanced Enforcement**: Particularly during peak hours and in high-violation areas to deter traffic and parking violations.
- **Public Education**: Focus on the dangers of distracted driving and the importance of adhering to traffic signals.
- **Technological Integration**: Utilization of automated speed cameras and collision avoidance systems to mitigate risk.

## Limitations and Assumptions
- The analysis is based on a representative sample from a single fiscal year, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.
- Assumptions regarding data completeness and accuracy were mitigated through rigorous data cleaning and validation techniques.

## Interactive Dashboard
An interactive Tableau dashboard provides stakeholders with the ability to explore data further:
- **Dashboard Features**: Users can filter violations by type, location, and time to pinpoint specific areas of concern.

## Conclusions
This comprehensive analysis underscores the need for targeted traffic enforcement and educational campaigns to enhance road safety in NYC. Future studies could expand on multi-year data to validate these findings and refine enforcement strategies.
